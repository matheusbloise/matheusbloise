# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with more than 6 years working in the PHP and JavaScript ecosystem, most of the time working as a backend developer. 

My focus as an engineer is on the core concepts, theory and pratice working together, thatâ€™s becoming me better daily as a software developer and Iâ€™m completely passionate to solve real problems with code, this passion took me across several large projects impacting directly thousand people.

"For me quality and good pratices shouldnâ€™t have tradeoffs"
